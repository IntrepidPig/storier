				<p class="u-full-width body">Yesterday a reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/grokdesigns">/u/grokdesigns</a> was kind enough to gift me a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M1C0186/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_yewGzbC19E66S">switch</a> for my budding homelab. I made a help post on reddit asking for advice on the cheapo switch I was planning on buying, and he hopped in out of the blue and offered to send me one of his similar ones for free. This blew me away, and after looking at his blog that was linked from his flair, it even inspired me to start my own, thus the page you are reading right now. I hope to make this eventually a unique blog that offers YADV (yet another developer's view) on all the dawning tech of this age (among other things), so with that said, welcome to my blog!</p>
